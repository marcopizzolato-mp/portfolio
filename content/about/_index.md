Dynamic and energetic, I am a driven individual who is passionate about the projects I take on. I am always looking for new challenges that will push my limits, bring out my creativity, and allow me to find innovative solutions. I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and work closely with my team and peers to build lasting relationships and achieve common goals.

In this space you will find a collection of my favorite projects and data adventures I have completed across my career. From when I was responding to the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan to earning my MSc in GIS at the University of Edinburgh and more recently pursuing my PG Degree in Data Engineering.
