# Where maps are missing

In today's world, discovering uncharted territories is increasingly rare, yet this remains a reality in South Sudan.   

Unlike places where towns are distinctly marked from start to end, often signaled by road signs, South Sudan presents a different scenario. 
There are a handful of concrete buildings, with most of the population leaving in huts of mud and dry grass that can rise pretty quickly in fertile areas but also just as fast disappear under the sun and rain when abandoned. 
There are a few major roads and the roads between villages are seasonal, vanishing with the rains and reemerging in the dry season, maybe in the same place maybe not.   

In an era dominated by smartphones, where we can pinpoint our location and destination with a few clicks, navigating a country where phone coverage and electricity are scarce presents unique challenges.   
 
Adding complexity, an ongoing civil war severely restricts safe travel and has led to large numbers of internally displaced persons moving within and beyond the countryâ€™s borders.
    
To support the work of the humanitarian organizations operating in the Country I published different reference maps, merging many different available datasets and checking them against local knowledge where possible.
